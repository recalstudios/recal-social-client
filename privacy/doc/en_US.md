# Introduction

As an online chat service, Recal Social needs to collect some user data. Our priority is your privacy, and by such, we
only collect information that is necessary for the operation of the service. The users of the service need to understand
and consent to this to use the service. This document provides information about what data we collect, why we collect
it, and the rights you have as a user of the service.

All your data is stored in Norway, and is by extension protected by Norwegian laws and the GDPR. You can read the
relevant laws here:

- [Act relating to the processing of personal data (The Personal Data Act) - Lovdata](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NLE/lov/2018-06-15-38)
- [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – Official Legal Text](https://gdpr-info.eu/)

If you have any questions regarding the privacy of the service or the information we collect, don't hesitate to contact
us at [soni@recalstudios.net](mailto:soni@recalstudios.net).

# Collected data

We collect the following data:

- Email address

Your email address is used for identification, password resetting, and optional newsletters.

_Note that some of these features are not yet available, but the information must still be collected to be used in the
future._

# Your rights

Following is an outline of your rights as a user of the service, as described by Norwegian law.

### Right to have insight

If you're unsure about what information we collect and what we use it for, contact us! It's your right as a user to have
insight as to how your data is being used.

You have a right to ask for any of the following:

- What is the purpose of collecting my data?
- What data do you currently store about me?
- Have you handed out my data, or is this going to happen? If so, who are the recipients? If a recipient is outside the
EU/EEA or an international organization, what can you guarantee for my privacy?
- How long do you keep my data? If it is impossible to provide a specific time frame, what decides how long it is being
stored for?
- To what degree do I have a right to correction, deletion or delimitation, or object to the use of my personal data?
- Where do we collect your data?
- Do you make automated individual decisions? If so, what logic lies behind, and what consequences can it have for me?

You can also ask for a copy of all the data we have stored about you, including electronic traces, metadata and what
personal profiles you are assigned.

If you send the inquiry electronically, the copy you receive must also be electronic and in a standard file format. We
must give you access without undue delay and normally within one month at the latest.

You have a right to have insight so that you as a user of the service can know how your data is being used and to
potentially detect incorrect information.

As per your rights, insight to your data must be free. However, we can in some cases ask for a reasonable administration
fee, for example if you ask for multiple copies or excessive/groundless demands.

There are, however, some exceptions where we can deny insight. The right to have insight does not apply if:

- The information is of importance to Norway's foreign policy interests or national defense and security interests. This
exception only applies if exceptions can also be made from public access to such information according to [Sections 20 and 21 of the Public Information Act](https://lovdata.no/NLE/lov/2006-05-19-16/§20).
- It is required to keep the information confidential for the sake of prevention, investigation, disclosure or
prosecution of criminal offenses.
- It is inadvisable for you to have insight to the information for reasons of your health or your relationship with
close relatives.
- The information is subject to statutory confidentiality.
- It is contrary to obvious and fundamental private or public interests to provide insight, including consideration for
yourself.
- The insight will infringe the rights and freedoms of others.
- there are archival purposes in the public interest, purposes related to scientific or historical research or
statistical purposes that will require a disproportionately large effort, or where the right to have insight is likely
to make it impossible or to a serious extent prevent the goals of the processing.

If we deny insight, you must get a written reason without undue delay and normally within one month at the latest. We
must also give a precise reference to which exemption authority is the reason, i.e. why you are not allowed insight.

### Right for correction

If any of our data regarding you is incorrect, you have a right for it to be corrected. To use this right, contact us
and specify the data to be corrected. We are obliged to fix it within one month at the latest.

There are, however, some cases where correction is not practically possible, for example if the data is correct but
gives a wrong impression. In such cases, you can demand the information to be more complete.

### Right for deletion

Your data can be deleted, but only in some specific cases. This is often referred to as the "right to be forgotten".

You can demand deletion of your data in the following cases:

- If you make use of your right to object to the use of your personal data, and there are no compelling reasons for the
processing.
- If you have consented to our usage of your data, and you withdraw your consent.
- If you are a minor and have used a digital service, such as social media.
- If it is no longer necessary to keep your information - the purpose of the information has been achieved.
- If the information has been obtained illegally.
- If we have an obligation to delete, according to the law.

We must carry out deletion without an undue delay and normally within one month at the latest.

There are, however, some exceptions to the aforementioned list. The right for deletion does not apply in the following
cases:

- The personal information is included in a statement protected by freedom of speech and information.
- Storage of the personal information is necessary for archiving in the public interest, scientific or historical
research purposes or statistical purposes. The exception only applies if deletion seriously prevents the goals from
being achieved. Furthermore, Article 89 of the Personal Data Protection Regulation states that these types of processing
of personal data must have measures and guarantees to safeguard the individual's privacy.
- We have a storage obligation by law (for example, bookkeeping obligation).
- Storage is necessary for certain types of use within health services (according to Article 9 of the Personal Data
Protection Regulation).
- Storage is necessary to establish, enforce or defend legal claims.

If we have handed out your data to other businesses, and you use your right for deletion, we have a duty to pass on the
information to businesses that have your information.

### Right for delimitation

In some cases, you can request the way we use your personal data to be limited. In that case, your personal data may be
stored but not used for anything.

In the following situations, you can demand limitation of the processing of personal data:

- You believe that the information stored about you is incorrect. While we check the information, the processing may be
limited for a period of time.
- You have used your right to object, and the company is in the process of deciding whether to accept your objection.

You can also use the right for delimitation to prevent your personal data from being deleted. This applies in these
cases:

- Personal data is processed illegally and must be deleted, but you want their use to be limited rather than deleted.
- We must delete the information because it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. You need
the information to determine, assert or defend a legal claim and therefore want it to be stored.

When the processing of personal data is limited, we must store the data, but not use it for anything without your
consent. There are a few exceptions, including if we need the information to establish, enforce or defend a legal claim
or to protect another person's rights. It may also be necessary to process the personal data for important public
interests, but this type of processing will usually be authorized by law.

We must provide for a limitation without undue delay and normally within one month at the latest.

You must always be notified before a limitation is lifted.

### Right to object

If you feel like your personal data has been processed without your consent and that you have lost control over your
data, you have a right to object.

The right to object does not apply in the following cases:

- The personal information is necessary to carry out an agreement you have with us.
- We are required by law or regulation to process your personal data. This applies to public enterprises in the vast
majority of cases.
- It is necessary for us to process the information in connection with a legal claim, for example a lawsuit or a claim
for compensation.
- Personal data is processed for the purposes of research or statistics, and the processing is necessary for us to be
able to carry out a task in the public interest.

The right to object also does not apply if we can show that weighty reasons precede your objection. In this assessment,
it may matter how the processing of personal data affects you.

If the purpose of the personal data is direct or customized marketing, you always have the right to object. There are no
exceptions to this rule, so we must respect your objection.
